# Timeline Example

Use the `HorizontalTimeline` [contraption](../../docs/core.md#contraption) to display a multi-row timeline.

In the events row:
 - Select events by clicking on them
 - Resize events by dragging their edges
 - Translate events by dragging their centers
 - Press `A` to toggle whether CSS class `alert` is set on the selected event
 - Press `Delete` to remove the selected event

Drag timeline row labels to reorder rows.
